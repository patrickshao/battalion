# Spring Hackathon 2015 Project 
Honorable Mention for Best Design and Best Game at the 5C Spring 2015 Hackathon.

A strategy game inspired from Risk. Players can position their three classes of units and play against another in attempt for ultimate dominance. The board size is variable.

Similarly to rock paper scissors, each class is strong against another class and equal to the other class. During a turn, the player has two options: to create a new connection to a node or to move to another node. In the case that the node contains an enemy, combat will take place through the rolling of six dice. This is when the rock paper scissors mechanics take place, as the advantageous class (Heavy->Light->Archer->Heavy) wins in cases of ties. 

After a turn takes place, all nodes that are owned will gain one new unit, with no limt.
